# Tick-Tack-Toe Local 2 Player
TTT is the most well-known game that has been implemented and played in so many ways for users to play. You can play this game in different variants. Boardgames and of course websites. 

For example, tick-tac-toe is a very simple website so you and your friends can come together and play in their own time by passing over the phone so they can take their turn. 

The audience for this website is for all ages and is very user-friendly as it's very simple and straight to the point. Click/Pass/Play.

## Features

__Gaming Layout__
You will be introduced with a basic layout of the Tick-Tac-Toe game that everyone knows, the squares are relatively large for everyone 
to clearly see and interact with by either finger touch or clicking. The functions of the grids are designed for the players to take turns
so once the action from the X player has been triggered it will be Y players turn then so on until the game is complete.

__Alerts / Reset Button__
When the correct sequence has been completed an alert will be triggered for BOTH players and this will say 
- Depends on who wins it will alert the user that has won at the botton of the screen for example __Player X Won__ once this
event has happened you cannot continue the game and will be forced to click the __RESET__ button.

## Design
I have went for the old school game vibe style, it's very arcade designed and very simple. I have themed the background color to be a nice 
grey and black as it's very easy to see and lovely to the eye. When playing the game the 'X' & 'O' have a vibrant color so it's easy to see when 
playing. 

The layout of the page is made to be simple and user friendly on all devices as shown above, this was the aim as this is a 2 player chill with friends
type of game where they can pass the phone when it's there turn. 

__Footer__ 
I have added all the social media pages that would be associated to the webpage, the designs of the buttons have been linked with Font-Awesome website, all 
icons have been added and styled to be a decent amount of size and colored to set the page theme. 

## Testing / Bugs
When testing the website I ran through so many issues and one of them being that when it come to the point of loading into GitHubs public page 
the javascript just didn't want to work. It has me baffled for a while checking the console errors and I just couldn't get my head around is 
it was stating it wasn't being linked via the inspect element. For the fix I finally realised which was mentioned in the previous tutorials that you should
always put the javascript script link at the botton of the bottom as it can cause issues, thankfully it was.

## Page Validation Testing
I have tested the HTML Val, there are no ERRORS but few warnings.

# Deployment 
The site was deployed to GitPages. The steps to deploy are:

1. In the GitHub repo, navigate to settings tab
2. From source, go to the drop down menu and select Master Branch
3. Once you select the master branch you will get a live link with the provided site.

## Later editions
I would be adding a scoreboard so players can keep track of the scores with a nice scoreboard added and to remove the alert saying
who's turn is it next to play when the game is won, unfortunately no time to implement.

# Credits 

Footer was inspired from the Love Running project that was in the previous assignments, 

Everything created I have had inspiration from many places such as watching countless hours of YouTube videos and watching
people on how they do it.

## Overall / Bugs

I thought the project went well, it was super hard for me at least as this was super challenging for me, finding time through the chirstmas period
was hard but overall think I have done well, Appreciate you reading this and accesssing it, have an awesome day!
